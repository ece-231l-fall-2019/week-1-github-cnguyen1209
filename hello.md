### Hello! Here is some thing about me

My name is *Cong Nguyen*.
I am from **Vietnam**.
I hope I will improve my C++ skills after this class.
I want to go around a world and take many landscape photos.

![Image of fireworks](https://github.com/ece-231l-fall-2019/week-1-github-cnguyen1209/blob/master/fireworks.jpg)

I took this picture on *July 4th*.
This is the first time I took photos of fireworks.
It was a great experience.
I used a photography technique called ***long exposure***
