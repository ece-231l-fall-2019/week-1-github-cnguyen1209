#Hello! Here is some thing about me

My name is *Cong Nguyen*.
I am from Vietnam.
I hope I will improve my C++ skills after this class.
I want to go around a world and take many landscape photos.

###This is my photo

I took this picture on July 4th.
This is the first time I took photos of fireworks.
It was a great experience.
I used a photography technical called long exposure
