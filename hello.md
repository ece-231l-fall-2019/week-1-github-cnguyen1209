![Image of fireworks](https://github.com/ece-231l-fall-2019/week-1-github-cnguyen1209/blob/master/fireworks.jpg)

I took this picture on *July 4th, 2019*.
This is the first time I took photos of fireworks.
It was a great experience.
I used a photography technique called ***long exposure***. 
It took me 20s to take this photo.
